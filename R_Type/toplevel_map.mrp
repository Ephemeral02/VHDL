  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   2 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator
   MIPS/XLXI_3/Mrom_inst_out_15_8_varindex0000341_6 failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer MIPS/XLXI_3/Mrom_inst_out_15_8_varindex000091_5_f5.  There is a
   conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   MIPS/XLXI_6/Jump_Reg_cmp_eq0000 is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network MIPS/XLXI_5/Mram_RAM_ren64/SPO has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 127 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   MIPS/XLXI_5/Mram_RAM_ren62/SPO,
   MIPS/XLXI_5/Mram_RAM_ren61/SPO,
   MIPS/XLXI_5/Mram_RAM_ren63/SPO,
   MIPS/XLXI_5/Mram_RAM_ren59/SPO,
   MIPS/XLXI_5/Mram_RAM_ren58/SPO
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
